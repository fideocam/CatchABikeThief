# CatchABikeThief

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

The purpose of this project is to develop image recognition application using AI that can recognize stolen bikes on online markets. The sales pictures and sales text ofter of suspected advertisements do have matching criteria that can be taught to a machine learning algorithm.

## Background

Millions of bicycles are stolen every year and it is a huge inconvenience for the owners. Polce do not have the resources to hunt down the perpetratoris. Often insurance pays for lost bikes and that drives up the home insurance costs unnnecessarily. 

## How is it used?

The tool is ran periodically and resultse sent to police and to marketplace operators.

## Data sources and AI methods

Lists of stolen bikes can be found on fillaritori.com. Stolen bikes are commonly sold on sites like Facebook Marketplace, Tori.fi and huuto.net.

## Challenges

The solution does not fix the sociaeconomic and health care issues that have an effect on rampant bike theft 

## What next?

The first thing is to gather enough material to train the algorith to find suspected
